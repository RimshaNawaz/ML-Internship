# Task 1:  Data Manipulation with pandas 

This Python script performs data manipulation tasks using the pandas library.

## Description

The script accomplishes the following steps:

1. **Load Dataset**: Loads the dataset from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Clean Data**: Removes any duplicate rows or missing values from the DataFrame.
3. **Extract Relevant Columns**: Extracts a subset of relevant columns for analysis.
4. **Calculate Total Sales**: Calculates the total sales amount for each product line category.
5. **Identify Top-Selling Product**: Identifies the top-selling product line by quantity ordered and its sales quantity.
6. **Generate Summary Report**: Generates a summary report with descriptive statistics for numerical columns.
7. **Export Processed Data**: Exports the cleaned and processed data to a new CSV file.


## Prerequisities
Make sure you have following libraries installed:

- pandas
- Python 3.x
- pandas library
You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

  

# Task 2:  NumPy Data Processing Script

This script performs various data processing tasks using NumPy, a powerful library for numerical computing in Python.

## Description

The script accomplishes the following tasks:

1. **Load Dataset**: Loads the dataset from a CSV file into a NumPy array.
2. **Calculate Statistics**: Calculates the mean, median, and standard deviation of the dataset.
3. **Normalize Data**: Normalizes the dataset using the z-score normalization technique.
4. **Identify Outliers**: Identifies outliers in the dataset using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
5. **Element-wise Operations**: Performs element-wise mathematical operations on the dataset.
6. **Reshape Dataset**: Reshapes the dataset into a different dimension.
7. **Save Processed Data**: Saves the processed data as a NumPy binary file.

## Prerequisities
Make sure you have following libraries installed:

- pandas

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

```bash
pip install numpy
```


# Task 3: Data Visualization with Matplotlib

## Description
This project performs data visualization using Matplotlib on a dataset containing passenger information. The dataset includes variables such as PassengerId, Survived, Pclass, Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, and Embarked. The tasks performed include:

1. Loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Creating a line plot to visualize the trend of a specific variable over time.
3. Generating a bar chart to compare the distribution of a categorical variable.
4. Constructing a scatter plot to examine the relationship between two numerical variables.
5. Designing a histogram to display the distribution of a continuous variable.
6. Customizing the visualizations by adding appropriate labels, titles, and legends.
7. Saving the generated plots as image files (e.g., PNG, JPEG).

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.x installed on your computer.
- The following Python packages installed:
  - pandas
  - matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```


# Task 4: Advanced Data Visualization with Pandas and Matplotlib

## Description
This project demonstrates advanced data visualization techniques using Pandas and Matplotlib libraries in Python. The provided code accomplishes the following tasks:

1. Loads a dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Performs data preprocessing tasks, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
3. Utilizes pandas to create a pivot table for summarizing the data.
4. Generates a box plot to compare the distributions of multiple variables across different categories.
5. Creates a stacked area chart to visualize the composition of different variables over time.
6. Develops a heat map to display the correlation matrix of the numerical variables.
7. Combines multiple visualizations into a dashboard-like layout using Matplotlib's subplots.
8. Saves the final visualization dashboard as a PDF document.
